            <h2 class="subheading">What is a Raspberry Pi?</h2>
            <p class="post-text">A Raspberry Pi is a powerful, tiny computer, about the size of your hand, it has no built-in storage, but you can add an SD card to add storage to run any program, Pi's are extremely customizable, with many different accessories, see https://raspberrypi.com for more!</p>
            <h2 class="subheading">OctoPrint</h2>
            <p class="post-text">OcotoPrint is a powerful program, designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, but can run on pretty much any system or old laptop. This program is designed to connect to any 3D printer that utilizes G-Code commands, and allows you to do many things with your printer, like control it directly from your PC/Laptop, or with certain plugins control the printer from anywhere. Certain plugins allow you to view and monitor from popular networking apps, such as Discord and Slack, others allow you to make stunning timelapses, with OctoPrint plugins, you can do anything. OctoPrint was started in 2012, by Gina Häußge, who initially developed the software for her own 3D printer.</p>
            <h2 class="subheading">PiVpn</h2>
            <p class="post-text">PiVpn is an application for a raspberry pi, that allows anyone to make and use their own VPN, only paying for the raspberry pi itself, as well as being able to fully manage the VPN, instead of paying VPN services. 0-kaladin, the creator of PiVPN, came across the Pi-Hole project, and saw how easy the installation was, then took the scripts from StarshipEngineer and merged them into PiVPN, creating a stable, steady and safe VPN to be used anywhere.</p>
